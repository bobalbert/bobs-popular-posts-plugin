bobs-popular-posts-plugin
=========================

Simple Plugin to track popularity of posts based on views and displays in a widget.
;-) help from Morten Rand-Hendriksen: @mor10 - http://mor10.com

The WordPress plugin stores page views for given posts in a custom post meta for users that are not loggedin. So doesn't track author or admin views.
Then a simple widget queries for the top 5 posts based on the value in that custom post meta. Auto sets the custom post meta for the post on first view so you don't have to add it to previously published posts.
Also allows your to add your own data from other sources, like start the value based on FB Likes or something like that.

Just some noodling around
